# ECE2360FinalProject
Currently, wifi is connected to my hotspot, not a network.
Need to test with independent power source as well.
Setup:
- Compile and run
- Activate Hotspot (Will hopefully work for wifi and hotspot in the future)
- In bluetooth settings, ensure 'SpotifyRemote' is connected
- Once wifi and bluetooth are connected, it should function

Description:
This project is a Spotify remote with basic functionality such as:
- Opening and closing Spotify on computer
- Play and pause
- Skip forward and backward
- Adjusting volume
- motion sensing

The code is used for the ESP32 microcontroller and uses components:
- buttons
- I2C lcd screen
- PIR motion detection sensor
- LEDS and resistors
- potentiometer
- A lot of wires!

This project also uses:
- Wifi connection
- Bluetooth (low energy)
